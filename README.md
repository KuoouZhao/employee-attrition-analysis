# employee-attrition-analysis
This project looks into employee attrition using real-world HR data. I started by analyzing patterns in departments, satisfaction scores, salary levels, and recruitment channels to understand what might be driving employees to leave.
After the initial analysis, I trained a logistic regression model to predict which employees are most likely to leave. The model reached 97% accuracy on the test set. The goal is to help HR teams identify high-risk cases early and reduce unnecessary turnover.
This report summarizes key findings, visual insights, and the predictive model used.
