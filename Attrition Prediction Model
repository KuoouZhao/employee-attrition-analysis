##To proactively identify employees who are at risk of leaving, a logistic regression model was trained using selected features such as satisfaction, engagement, salary, tenure, and absences.

- Features used: EmpSatisfaction, EngagementSurvey, Salary, Tenure, Absences, etc.
- Target variable: Termd (1 = Left, 0 = Stayed)
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Train/test split: 70/30

Accuracy: 97%
Confusion Matrix:
[[66  0]
 [ 3 25]]
F1-Score for class "Left": 0.94

The model shows strong performance in identifying potential leavers, with 97% accuracy. It can be used by HR teams to flag high-risk employees and intervene early.
